                    <h5>About Me üòé: <br>
                        Hey there! My Name is <i> <strong>Yunus Oluwadamilare Kelani</strong> </i>,
                        I‚Äôm someone with a background in Science Laboratory Technology and Microbiology
                        from Kwara State Polytechnic. I graduated in 2022, and not long after, I found a new
                        passion‚Äîtech. I‚Äôm currently on a self-taught journey into web development, learning one line of
                        code at a time. It hasn‚Äôt been easy,
                        but every challenge has helped me grow.
                        <br>
                        Outside the screen, I‚Äôm someone who values simplicity, faith, and meaningful connections. I
                        enjoy learning new things, reflecting quietly, and having deep or playful conversations when the
                        vibe is right. I‚Äôm not just building skills‚ÄîI‚Äôm building a future.

                        The Story is long but let be brief, Yah!!! After I graduated in August 2022, I found myself
                        drawn to the world of tech.
                        With no background in programming, I decided to teach myself from scratch.
                        I started watching free tutorials, reading articles, and trying out small
                        projects. Every new thing I learned‚Äîlike building a form or styling a button‚Äîfelt like
                        a big win. I‚Äôm still learning, still making mistakes, but I‚Äôve come a long way from not knowing
                        what HTML was. I might be a beginner,
                        but I‚Äôm serious about growing and building something meaningful.

                    <h5>üåç Social Life: <br>
                        Actually, I‚Äôm naturally calm and observant, but once I‚Äôm comfortable, I enjoy connecting with
                        people. I‚Äôm
                        not the loudest in the room, but I‚Äôm the type that listens and contributes meaningfully. I enjoy
                        deep conversations, light-hearted jokes, and positive energy. I respect my boundaries and faith,
                        so I try to surround myself with people who understand balance‚Äîfun, but focused. Whether it's
                        chatting in a small circle or sharing ideas online, I try to bring honesty and a good vibe
                        wherever I go. Social life for me isn‚Äôt about quantity, it‚Äôs about quality connections.
